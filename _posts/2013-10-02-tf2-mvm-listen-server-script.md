This script for Team Fortress simplifies the process of setting up and running
an Mann vs. Machine listen server. It allows the server to run a config to prep
the server for MvM, select an MvM map, and then change the difficulty at any
given time during the game.  

It was crafted with use among friends that don't want to install Metamod:Source
and Sourcemod but still want to have the ability to administrate and manage a
listen server. Releases and source code are [found at
Github](https://github.com/terrehbyte/mvm-listenserver-script).
