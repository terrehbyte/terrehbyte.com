Finding the inspiration to actually write something was arguably the hardest
part for me as a writer. Back when I was young, naive, and ambitious (i.e. two
years ago), I wanted to write a novel. It was November and NaNoWriMo had just
begun. I had no plot, no plan, no clue, and no real desire to actually complete
that thing. Completing an entire novel just wasn't something feasible for me.
Try as I would, each successive attempt would be equally met with
self-depreciation and dissatisfaction.  

I held myself (and others) to high standards. Before that, I had attempt to
co-run a gaming blog with a friend of mine, only to end up criticizing the
quality of his writing as well as the overall layout of the blog. I suppose my
biggest problem was having high standards that I didn't know how to meet. It was
like trying to hammer in a nail with my bare hands: the lack of tools only
exacerbated the fact that my skills lacked refinement. I was far from hitting
the nail right on the head.  

So here I am, two years later, with the teachings of "Shrunk and White" and
parallelism fresh in my head, and with some better tools this time around.
Ren'Py is the visual novel engine that I'll be working in part due to the fact
that I am incapable of creating my own visual novel engine at the moment. That
leaves the fact that I'm also trying to learn some iteration of Python at the
same time; what better way is there to learn a language than to really work with
it and learn as you go? You're bound to develop some understanding of it at some
level.  

Some people would say that writers write in a way that reflect their own
experiences. That would especially be the case in something such as a memoir
(something I've considered writing). Lacking a team of writers as well as a
surplus of creativity, I figured that I'd write from my own school experiences.
Sometimes they'd require a little bit of tweaking, but that won't always be the
case.
