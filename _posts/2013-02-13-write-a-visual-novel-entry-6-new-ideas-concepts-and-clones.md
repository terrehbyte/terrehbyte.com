Let's think in hypothetical terms. Let's say that you have a clone who are at
this very time. Let's say that this clone, at the point of creation, was exactly
the same as you were in both mind and body, but not place, because then we'd
have two things occupying the same space, and who knows what would happen then.
What would you do?  

I've always dreamt of having a clone of myself that I could work together with.
It's not because I love or lust for myself excessively so, but if I could have a
clone, then I could get twice the amount of work done in the same amount of
time, provided that I could merge with my clone and merge our intelligence
together into one, but we wouldn't really have a conflict if we could hide
ourselves with just a snap of the fingers.  

Clones are not exactly commonplace. I don't know about you, but I haven't seen
anyone else walk around with a clone, short of twins and triplets and
quadruplets and so on and so forth. It's no surprise that the media and the
science community would be very interested in attempting to unravel behind such
a phenomena. Public interest withstanding, a clone left unannounced would also
be an illegal citizen, and therefore ineligible for things like a driver's
license without (falsely?) working under the name of the original person.  

I'm still trying to work out the plot and the like, so there is more to come,
but I'll try to keep my non-existent readers up-to-date. I'm looking forward to
playing with the meaning of life, the definition of a person, and the heart
behind a person's emotions.
