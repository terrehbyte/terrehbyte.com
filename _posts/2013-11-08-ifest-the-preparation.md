iFEST isn't quite ready to open to the public yet, but I volunteered to help
exhibitors set up for today. Getting a peek at things behind the scenes was
great as I got to meet some really neat people. All of the expensive gear from
the [Seattle VRcade](http://youtu.be/2fz0_KmWkUI) guys made me really nervous
though; their gear is incredibly expensive so handling their motion tracking
cameras was scary, but manageable.  

Other game exhibitors brought in presentation materials and of course, the
actual games that are being shown, but I'm even more excited for the people who
hadn't shown up yet since there are some interesting names like
[MOGA](http://www.mogaanywhere.com), which makes phone controllers, that will
also be showing up on the day of the event. I'll have to cut this short since I
don't want to give away too much before the event takes place, but it's
definitely not something I want to miss out on. I'm glad I get to not only
attend this year, but lend a hand in running it.
