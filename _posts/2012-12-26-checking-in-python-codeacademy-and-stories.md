It's been quite some time since the last update, so let's do a quick rundown of
virtually everything that I've done! This'll be a short post.  

## Python and Codecademy  

In order to supplement the fact that the visual novel project has come to a
grinding halt in recent weeks, I'm reviewing and picking up on additional things
through lessons at [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/). I'm still sticking
with the Ren'Py visual novel engine, so that isn't changing. I've been flow
charting the common route, and though having a point-based decision system
sounds nice, I've concluded that a simple diverging route should be more than
enough for me.  

## Stories  

The visual novel project has come to a halt but not because I don't want to work
it. School has been keeping me busy as of late, and although decisions keep
coming to me, fitting them all together can prove difficult.  

## Will I keep working at things?  

Heck yeah, I will keep working at things! I'm rather glad that I'm not paid to
write or program a visual novel because I'd probably do a terrible job, I'd be
burnt out, and I'd be fresh out of ideas in a week.
