Early on in the project, I had assigned themes to everyone's routes. For
example, Character 1's route was considered to be the rational and unworldly
route, a path best suited towards those who did not have an incredible
attachment to material things. On the other hand, Character 2's route was the
designated route for those who were more worldly or attached to material
possessions.  

Initially speaking, the idea that caused me to start developing this visual
novel was that it revolved around materialism. Do you place too much value in
the things you own? Is the matter that makes up the item much more valuable to
you than the sentimental value you've attached to it? Are neither important at
all?  

It's more of a springboard now and not a guiding idea.  

P.S. I've lost track of the days, so I'm switching over to entries.
