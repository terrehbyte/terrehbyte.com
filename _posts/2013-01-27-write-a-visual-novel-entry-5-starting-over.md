It's been quite a while since I wrote my last entry. The last few have just been
sitting on my netbook for weeks, so I figured I'd slowly offload them onto here.
Since then, I've come up with quite a number of choice events and situations
that the protagonist could get into, but I can't help but feel as though that
I'm lacking a plot or driving force. Though this project was first created in
order to facilitate the learning of Python, I can't help but feel as though that
it can be difficult to find time for it while at the same time, I find myself
thinking about it from time to time.  

I don't even know how to feel about this. Maybe it is more of a case of not
knowing what I should think about this, but I'm finding it hard to describe what
I'm thinking. It isn't as though I want to say that I'm quitting this project
(far from it, really), but at the same time, I'm finding it hard to really dig
deep and pull out this amazing story from my sleeve. Of course, no one does
that.  

But not all is lost: I've got an idea I want to flesh out a bit more before I
write about it. Stay tuned.
