I should have done this a few days ago, but other projects took precedence. In
any case, I did a small overhaul of the listen server setup script for Team
Fortress 2's listen server mode that fixed some bugs and made things a bit more
extensible. Poor scripting caused servers to restart between maps while other
issues made it difficult to make use of, but hopefully those problems have been
solved..  

The biggest change would be the transition towards renaming the map name aliases
to no longer use the "map" command for map changes. A separate file redefines
the aliases to use "changelevel" instead. This prevents the server from being
created anew each map change.  

Finally, support was added for all of the other missions that are available from
the "boot camp" menu in Team Fortress 2's MvM matchmaking system. A quick look
at the population files in the game files made it easier to get the names of
other missions that can be loaded into the game.  

As always, the script is available on [Github and contributions are
welcome](https://github.com/terrehbyte/mvm-listenserver-script).
