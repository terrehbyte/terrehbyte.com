If you’re the lucky owner of a Plantronics GameCom 377 or 367, you might have
discovered that your headset is [cracking somewhere along the
headband](http://soundingboard.plantronics.com/thread/17648). What’s worse is
that you can’t even buy a new one in stores, so you’re stuck with buying one
from eBay or Amazon if a replacement is what you’re in the market for.
Fortunately, if it hasn’t completely snapped apart, despair not for there is
still hope! They’re by no means perfect, but these “fixes” should keep your
headset together for some time longer.  

## Option A - Clamping the Gap in "Plantronics"

If you’re like me and are looking for an easy fix, but kind of ugly fix, then
you may want to consider heading down to a hardware store and picking up a small
clamp that you can use to put an iron grip on the two parts. If you also happen
to live near a DAISO Japan store, they carry small clamps that you can buy for a
dollar.  

## Option B - Wrap it Up with Metal

![Clean Solution](http://terrehbyte.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/900x900px-ll-1051feac_sspx2738crack.jpg)

This solution comes from eriktheg at Head-Fi Forums and involves some ability to
work with sheet metal and drills. By wrapping a piece of metal around the crack
in the headset, you can create a new band that isn't too high-profile and will
make sure that your worries will be a thing of the past. Detailed instructions
and diagrams are [found at their
