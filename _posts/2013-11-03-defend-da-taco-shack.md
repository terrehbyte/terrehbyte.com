Here's my entry for the 0h Game Jam of 2013! You are a lone warrior of with a nice tan who must defend a taco shack from flying burritos! Use the spacebar to shoot and hope you have a slow computer because there's no frame limit on this thing! I'm tired, so hit up the download for more information and the game itself.
