# About Terry

I've been working in **games** and **education** for almost 8 years since I
began my studies in programming. I'm currently a **Game Programming Instructor**
at the [**Academy of Interactive Entertainment**](https://seattle.aie.edu/) in Seattle, WA.

My time with in games and education have given me an amazing opportunity to
learn how different teams form and work together over time. I've really enjoyed
working with not only artists and designers but also physicians and writers to
create novel solutions to their problems.

I'm eager to continue working with teams that are excited to refine and improve
the things that they create!

I'm working part-time for an undisclosed studio as its **Principal Programmer**.
I am the sole engineer for the team and work closely our artists and designers.
I also work regularly with the producer to adjust timelines and plans based on
the project's progress.

My major contributions to the project to date:

  - Later, importing Ink and integrating it with existing dialogue front-ends
- Managing a persistent 3D world with a day/night cycle
- Designing and implementing a simple quest system with object lifecycle management
- Creating a UI management layer for pushing/popping UI screens and widgets
- Supporting our designers' visual scripting graphs (or reimplementing with C# if necessary)

A Steam release is expected in 2022.

### AIE Seattle
![Banner image for AIE Seattle featuring a screenshot of a demo project](/posts/about/aie_seattle.png)

I'm a faculty member working as a **Game Programming Instructor** at [**AIE
Seattle**](https://seattle.aie.edu). We deliver a two year course training
students to be ready to work in entry-level positions in games. Our work is
joined by the Game Art and 3D Animation; and Game Design and Production; departments.

In addition, I have led cross-discipline initiatives ranging from game jams to
full-blown production projects, guiding students from pre-production to release
on itch.io in tandem with AIE's Marketing department.

My responsibilities are as follows:

- Designing and implementing course content specialized for the Seattle Campus
- Mentoring students on their career plans and the steps needed to achieve them
- Providing administrative services for the on-site Perforce server
  - Migrating old Perforce projects off the server and onto Git with LFS ([AIE-Seattle-Prog/p4ToGitArchive](https://github.com/AIE-Seattle-Prog/p4ToGitArchive))
  - Training staff and students on the use of Git and Perforce version control systems
- Planning and coordinating concurrent student productions for Year 1 and Year 2 students
- Liasoning with other US campuses and leadership in Australia
- Coordinating with the AIE Marketing department to ensure delivery of student work for promotion

Each year, AIE Seattle faculty support students as they design, implement, and
release a number of student games from its end-of-year production projects.

A selection of recognized student production releases that I supported:

- [**DISCARDED**](https://aieseattle.itch.io/discarded) - collect toy parts and ascend this abandoned world to meet the "Manic Qing"
  - Seattle Indies Expo 2021 - Official Selection
  - Dreamhack Beyond 2021 - Student Game Showcase (Top 5)

### Vextar Dev Team
![Banner image for Vextar Dev Team featuring a screenshot of a Vextar](/posts/about/vextar.png)

I was the **Lead Programmer** for Vextar, a first-person multiplayer "disk-on-disk"
shooter action game where players attempt to bounce each other out of the arena
with projectile disks. It was inspired by classic arena shooters like Ricochet,
Quake, Doom as well as Tron, of course.

My responsibilities are as follows:

- Training the team up on Unreal Engine 4 (then recently released)
- Gluing C++ and Unreal Blueprints together to enable designers to integrate art and mechanics
- Synchronizing game state across clients in a server-client network model
- Exhibiting and collecting feedback from players who played the game on-site
- Prototyping new levels and mechanics

The project was showcased at venues such as PAX West (at our alma mater's
booth), SRGE (Seattle's Retro Gaming Expo), and SBDHH (Seattle's Best Damn Happy
Hour).
