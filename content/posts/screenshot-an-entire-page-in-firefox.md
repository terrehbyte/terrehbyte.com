I always wondered how people do this without an addon or plugin, and I finally
know how! I'll never remember it though, so here's a blogpost on it.

1. Press "SHIFT" and&nbsp; "F2" buttons at the same time to bring up the developer console.  
![Open the developer's console.](http://terrehbyte.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/step-1-open-the-dev-console.gif)  

2. Type "screenshot --fullpage" into the box or "developer console".  
![Enter the commands.](http://terrehbyte.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/step-2-enter-the-commands.gif)  

3. Press enter! It saves to your default Downloads folder. You can see the file path at the top.  
![Press enter!](http://terrehbyte.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/step-3-press-enter.gif)"  

Now you can upload entire screenshots from 4chan or Reddit or whatever odd
conversation you want to capture!
