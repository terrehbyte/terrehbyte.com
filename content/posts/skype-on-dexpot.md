title: Skype on Dexpot
---
Skype is rather fickle when it comes to running alongside an installation of
Dexpot. When you have more than one virtual desktop, it tends to refuse to
launch on more than one virtual desktop. Though this isn't exactly ideal, one
way to workaround that issue is to force Dexpot to replicate it throughout all
or certain virtual desktops.  

Dexpot users who enable the Desktop Pager plugin will be able to right click on
Skype in the pager and tell it to copy Skype to all or certain virtual desktops.
Other users will be able to right click on Skype's titlebar (i.e. the bar at the
top of any window) and perform the same set of actions to copy Skype to
individual or all virtual desktops. This also solves the problem regarding Skype
and Dexpot when Skype stops functioning properly when opened in more than one
virtual desktop.
