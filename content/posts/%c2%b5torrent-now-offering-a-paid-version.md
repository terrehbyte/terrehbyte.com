title: µTorrent - Now Offering a Paid Version?
---

I don't know if I'm going to keep using µTorrent because it's growing to be
anything but the lightweight BitTorrent client it used to be. My reasoning
behind that is not solely because of the introduction of a paid version, but
rather what the paid version has to offer.

Should you opt for the paid version, you will gain access to all features that
µTorrent currently has on top of the capability to...

1. ...convert files from one format to another.
2. ...play audio/video files downloaded via µTorrent.
3. ...protect yourself from viruses hiding in torrents.
4. ...securely access your files from across the globe.

You'll get the features listed above for getting the paid version of µTorrent.
I'm not buying the paid version because I don't want to pay, nor is it because
I'll just pirate it, but simply because I don't need my BitTorrent client to do
that. All I need are stability and security fixes which will come to the free
version. Everything else can be done through methods that don't cost a thing.  

### How do I it without paying a thing? [WinFF](http://winff.org/html_new) and
[Handbrake](http://handbrake.fr) are both capable of converting my media from
one format to another.  

[CCCP](http://cccp-project.net/) or
[VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) are both capable of playing
virtually any kind of media that I'm going to come across. CCCP is often
preferred for playing anime, though VLC Media Player works almost if not just as
well as CCCP and is cross-platform whereas CCCP is only available on Windows.  

[Microsoft Security
Essentials](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/security-essentials)
is a fine anti-virus provided free* of charge by Microsoft.

[Spybot Search & Destroy](http://www.safer-networking.org/dl/) protects me from
unwanted adware and spyware.  

[Malwarebytes](http://www.malwarebytes.org/) also has my back should I come
across something that manages to slip by.  

I don't even know where to start when talking about securely accessing files.
[LogMeIn](https://secure.logmein.com/) and
[Teamviewer](http://www.teamviewer.com/en/index.aspx) will let you access your
computer or files from another computer, while more computer savvy people may be
able to SSH in and get at what they want.  

You might even just redownload what you want from your home computer while
you're away from home. Unless they're going to eat up your home connection by
downloading and then reuploading the downloaded file to a cloud service that
would be faster than downloading the torrent again, this perk isn't that useful.

On a related note, more and more things are coming to the cloud, so accessing
your data from anywhere has never been easier given how connected certain places
of the world are with one another. We, on a global and physical scale, are
closer together than we ever have been.  

Did I mention all of the programs I mentioned above are free or have free
versions full of the core features you need for private/individual use?  

**Microsoft requires that you own a legitimate version of Microsoft Windows to
download and make use of their otherwise free anti-virus program.*
