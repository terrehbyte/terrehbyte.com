# Content Development at AIE

In addition to creating supplemental content, part of my week is dedicated to
prepping and developing course content for the whole institution (AIE Australia
and AIE USA).

Subjects that I have updated or written are as follows:

- Introduction to C++
- Introduction to C# for Game Programming
- Physics for Games
- Maths for Games
- Game Engine Scripting
