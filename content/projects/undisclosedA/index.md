# Undisclosed Project

![Banner image for unannounced studio](unannounced.png)

I worked for an undisclosed studio as its **Principal Programmer**. I was the
_sole engineer_ for the team and work closely with its artists and designers.

I also worked regularly with the producer to adjust timelines and plans based on
the project's progress.

My major contributions to the project to date:

- Prototyping a **dialogue system** for Unity with integrations for animations and gameplay mechanics
  - Later, integrating [**Ink**](https://github.com/inkle/ink) with existing dialogue front-end
- Managing a **persistent 3D world** with a day/night cycle
- Designing and implementing a **quest system** with object lifecycle management
- Creating a **UI management layer** for pushing/popping UI screens and widgets
- Supporting **Bolt visual scripting** graphs with designers (or reimplementing with C#)
- **Triaging bugs** and porting fixes between releases
- Upgraded the project from Unity 2019.X to 2020.X
- Prepare **game demo for release** during _Steam Next Fest June 2022 Edition_

The game was released on Steam release in September 2022. :rocket:
