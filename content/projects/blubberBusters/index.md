I provided my services as a **Build Engineer (Contract)**, working on **Blubber
Busters**, a run-and-gun 2D action platformer that pits players into the depths
of space (or space whales).

My responsibilities are as follows:

- Integrating code from **from Git (contractors) to Perforce (core team)**
- Resolving **build blockers** for the game build every month
- Managing the **Perforce server's settings** and provisioning team members with depot access
