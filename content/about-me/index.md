# About Terry

I've been working in **games** and **education** for almost 8 years since I
began my studies in programming. I'm currently a **Game Programming Instructor**
at the [**Academy of Interactive Entertainment**](https://seattle.aie.edu/) in Seattle, WA.

I'm happy to _work alongside with artists and designers_ on games as well as
_physicians and writers_ to translate abstract requirements into actionable
tasks for the development team.

I'm eager to continue working with teams that are excited to refine and improve
the things that they create!
