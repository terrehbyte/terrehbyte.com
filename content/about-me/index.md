# About Terry

I've been working in **games** and **education** for almost 9 years since I
started programming as a career. I'm currently a **Game Programming Instructor**
at the [**Academy of Interactive Entertainment**](https://seattle.aie.edu/) in
Seattle, WA.

I'm happy to work closely with everyone on a team to work together better and
create more engaging experiences overall.
